# Use-of-LSTM-Algorithms-and-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-for-Stock-Index-Prediction

#### Abstract: 
In this report, we propose a framework to predict the stock index price based on time series data and sentiment analysis from Mr. President Donald Trump’s twitter. For Trump’s tweets analysis, we use LDA model to derive 20 topics from his tweets and use VADER model to get sentiment analysis scores of each tweet. For time series data, we use LSTMs models to train data and compare results from different models. Experiment results show that the revised LSTMs models can predict stock index prices form different countries, moreover, we verify the social media sentiment especially Mr. President Trump’s tweets make influence on stock index price by capturing the volatility from our models.
